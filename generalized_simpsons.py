    members in a community, not just the ones that are identically matched.

    Idea published as "TCRdiv" in Dash et al. (2017) in the area of T cell receptor
    (TCR) analysis. The community is a TCR repertoire and the members are unique
    TCR clones.

    The diversity index is similar to Simpson's diversity index (SDI) in that it estimates
    the chance of sampling m members from the community that are all more similar
    to each other than some pre-specified threshold.

    Fuzzy diversity is the sum of the probability of n members that match exactly,
    plus the probability of m members matching within the threshold. Or it can be expressed
    as 1 - probability of drawing m members that are not similar (distance > threshold).

    For a confidence interval use some kind of bootstrap approach.

    Parameters
    ----------
    counts : np.ndarray [n]
        Number of observations of each member in the community
    pwmat : np.ndarray [n x n]
        Pairwise distances (not similarities) for all members in the community.
        Consider using 1 to represent members that are not similar, and 0 for others,
        or use the threshold parameter.
    order : int
        Order of the SDI, i.e. the number of members sampled to see if they are
        similar to one another
    threshold : float
        A distance threshold that defines whether two members are similar to one
        another: similar if distance < threshold
    force_sampling : bool
