    Use the Hungarian (Kuhnâ€“Munkres) algorithm to align two sets of cluster
    labels for the same dataset as phrased as a combinational optimziation
    algorithm that runs in O(n^3) time. Recreates the cluster labels for
    both versions of the cluster labels and returns them.

    Taken from this public implementation of the Munkres/Kuhns algorithm
    under the Apache 2 license.
    Can be found here: https://github.com/bmc/munkres

    Build a contengency matrix describing the relationship between labels.
    Parameters
    ----------
    clus1_labels : int array, shape = [n_samples]
        Ground truth class labels to be used as a reference
    clus2_labels : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Cluster labels to evaluate
    eps: None or float
        If a float, that value is added to all values in the contingency
        matrix. This helps to stop NaN propogation.
        If ``None``, nothing is adjusted.

    Returns
    -------
    contingency: array, shape=[n_classes_true, n_classes_pred]
        Matrix :math:`C` such that :math:`C_{i, j}` is the number of samples in
        true class :math:`i` and in predicted class :math:`j`. If
        ``eps is None``, the dtype of this array will be integer. If ``eps`` is
